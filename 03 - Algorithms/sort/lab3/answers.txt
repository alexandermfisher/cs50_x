sort1 uses:  Bubble Sort

How do you know?: sort1 perfromed much better on an already sorted set compared to the reversed set. This is indictive that it is bubble 

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It performs the best on average compared wth the other algorithms which implies it is most likely merge sort. 
In addition, similarly to selection sort the performance is roughly the same across the differnet inputs which corresponds to an algorithm with 
the same upper and lower bound time complexities.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It roughly performs the same independent of initial order which direcy indicates this must be selection sort.
